#' The \code{irtoys} package contains a bunch of functions potentially useful
#' to those teaching or learning Item Response Theory (IRT). R being 
#' particularly good at graphics, there is a rich array of plotting 
#' functions to visualize IRT models or assess their fit. Ability estimates 
#' can be estimated by MLE, BME, EAP, WLE. Various IRT scaling methods are supported: 
#' MM, MS, Stocking-Lord, and Hebaera. Last not least, \code{irtoys} may be
#' the only package to estimate Haberman's interaction model, although a new and
#' more powerful package is in the making.
#' 
#' Currently, there are several R packages that can estimate the item parameters
#' in various uni- and multidimensional IRT models, but only several years ago one
#' had to use stand-alone programs that had wildly different and
#' often unwieldy user interfaces. Besides, no single program does everything
#' one needs. One of the original purposes of \code{irtoys} was to provide a 
#' simple and unified interface to some of the most basic
#' functions in ICL, BILOG, and R's own \code{ltm}, such that beginners could
#' concentrate on learning IRT rather than syntaxes. Once that these steps 
#' have been made, those wishing to take
#' advantage of the full functionality of ICL, BILOG & Co. must still master
#' the syntax of their program of choice.
#' 
#' To take full advantage of \code{irtoys}, some IRT software is needed.
#' Package \code{ltm} is automatically loaded.  ICL by Brad Hanson can be
#' downloaded from his site, \url{http://www.openirt.com/b-a-h/software/}.
#' Executables and a very detailed manual (not needed to use ICL with 
#' \code{irtoys} are provided for Windows, Linux, and Macintosh. The Mac
#' version probably does not work with the current OS versions but I still
#' use the Windows and Linux versions without any problem.
#' 
#' 
#' BILOG is commercial software sold by SSI ---
#' see \url{https://ssicentral.com/} for further detail.
#' 
#' On Windows, make sure that the executable files (\code{icl.exe} for ICL,
#' \code{BLM1.EXE}, \code{BLM2.EXE}, and \code{BLM3.EXE} for BILOG) are located
#' in a directory that is included in the PATH variable.  On Linux, BILOG,
#' being a Windows program, is run with \code{wine}, and should also be on a
#' path where wine can find it.  On my machine, I have simply put the three
#' files in \code{~/.wine/drive_c/windows/}. It seems that new versions of wine
#' expect them to be explicitly tagged as executable. On Macintosh, at least
#' \code{ltm} should work in all cases.
#'
#' NOTE: Starting with version 0.2.0, function \code{est} returns a list of three
#' elements: \code{est} contains the parameter estimates and is thus identical
#' to the output in earlier versions, \code{se} contains the standard errors,
#' in a similar format, and \code{vcm} contains the variance-covariance matrices
#' (NULL when using ICL). When passing item parameters to another function that
#' only needs the estimates, \code{irf(ip)} and 
#' \code{irf(ip$est)} can be used interchangeably. This facilitates using simulated
#' item parameters. A function that does require the complete object is \code{}. 
#' 
#' Also, function \code{itf} now returns item fit statistics 
#' as a vector rather than a list. Finally, since most of the functions in \code{irtoys}
#' have been written with the "logistic" metric in mind (i.e., \eqn{a_j(\theta_i-b_j)}
#' rather than \eqn{1.7a^*_j(\theta_i-b_j)}, function \code{est} now estimates item 
#' parameters only in the logistic metric.

#' Original, unscored multiple-choice responses to a test
#' 
#' Real-life data set containing the responses to a test, before they have been
#' recoded as true or false. Can be used with only two functions in the
#' package: \code{scoreResponses} and \code{tgf}. All other functions expect binary data,
#' which can be produced with \code{scoreResponses}.
